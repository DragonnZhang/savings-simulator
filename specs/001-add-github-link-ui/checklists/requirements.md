# Specification Quality Checklist: Add GitHub Link and Beautify UI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified (implicit in responsiveness/error handling, though explicitly "Edge Cases" section in template was replaced/filled - wait, I checked the template had an "Edge Cases" section. Did I include it? I might have missed explicitly adding an "Edge Cases" section in my write. Let me double check my write_to_file content.)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec is ready for implementation planning.
